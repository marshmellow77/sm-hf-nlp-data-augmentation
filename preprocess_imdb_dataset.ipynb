This have tickled the right spot and I bought the movie.The disappointment started when I realized that the third way is to just sit down and count dead bodies followed by sitting down and counting dead bodies... Then I began to think \"hey, this story can\\'t be that simple... I bet this clever officer will find some cunning way to save what left of his troops\". Well, he didn\\'t, they were just sitting and waiting for something to happen. And so was I.The story was based on real events of World War I, so the writers couldn\\'t make much use of their imagination, but even thought I found this movie really unchallenging and even a little bit boring. And as I wrote in the first place - it isn\\'t fault of actors, writers or director - their marketing people have raised my expectations high above the level that this movie could cope with.'"
